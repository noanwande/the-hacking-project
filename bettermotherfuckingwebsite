<h1>This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website.</h1><p>

  And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.<p>
<h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>

    <h3>7 fucking declarations.</h3><p>

That's how much CSS it took to turn that grotesque pile of shit into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:<p><ul>

    <li>Shit's still lightweight and loads fast</li>
    <li>Still fits on all your shitty screens</li>
    <li>Still looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
    <li>The motherfucker's still accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
    <li>Shit's still legible and gets your fucking point across</li><p>
    
    <h2>And guess what, motherfucker:</h2>

You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.<p>

    <h1>Let it breathe</h1>

Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.<p>

If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.<p>
    
<h1>A little less contrast</h1>

Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.<p>

    <h1>Size Matters</h1>

I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.<p>
    
    <h1>Line-width, motherfucker</h1>

Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.<p>
    
    <h2>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h2>

I love what the creator of this <a href = "http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">site's inspiration </a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.<p>
